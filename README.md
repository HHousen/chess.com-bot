# chess.com-bot

Disclosure: This project is created purely with educational and research purposes in mind. Please only use this bot to play against the computer. **I do not condone using this bot in public matches for the purpose of cheating.**

Dependencies: https://stockfishchess.org/download/, https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

You need to download both binaries and put them in the project folder. The stockfish binary should be named "stockfish.exe" and the chrome driver binary should be named "chromedriver.exe".

To use the bot, open main.py and wait until the site has loaded. Press play against computer and click continue until you are at the main game window. Navigate over to your Python window and press any key to start the bot.

The bot currently cannot detect turn change; it plays a turn every 3 seconds. Detection will be implemented in a future update.
The bot does not currently support pawn promotions, but this feature will be implemented in a future update.
